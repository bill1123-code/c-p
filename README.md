Hello everyone
The c-p project is an open-source browser development project.
The goals that distinguish it from some other browsers are:

1_ Privacy-focused browsing
Isolating each site in a separate container
Each website runs in its own “sandbox” separated from others, so sites cannot track your activity across different sites.

Automatic session destruction
Browsing data (like cookies and history) are deleted automatically after a set time or when a tab is closed.

Complete fingerprinting prevention
Stops trackers from identifying you based on your browser’s unique features (device properties, fonts, audio/video settings) to make you look anonymous.

Fake/decoy browsing
Generates fake browsing activity in the background to confuse trackers and make your real activity less visible.

Encrypted local browsing history
Stores browsing history encrypted on your device so no one can access it without your permission.

Silent mode
Blocks sites from sending notifications or requesting permissions (like camera or microphone) entirely.

No user data collection
Ensures no personal data or browsing behavior is sent, sold, or shared outside your device.

2_ Secure browsing
Panic button
A button to instantly close the browser and erase all browsing data and cookies in emergency situations.

Built-in local VPN/Proxy
Encrypted connection that hides your IP address and secures your browsing without needing external services or accounts.

Built-in browser firewall
Prevents the browser from connecting to suspicious or harmful internet addresses to protect you from attacks.

Email and password leak monitoring
Alerts you if your email or passwords have been leaked in known databases.

Silent mode
As mentioned above, prevents notification and permission requests that might threaten your security.

Encrypted local browsing history
Protects your browsing data even if someone accesses your device.

Local built-in VPN
Double protection via a locally encrypted network for safe browsing.

3_ High speed
Optimized for fast and smooth performance on all devices.

4_ Multilingual support
Enables using the browser in multiple languages to serve users worldwide.

Currently, the project is still just an idea at the time of writing this.
